Implementation Of Go To Forest Game :

Now we will start how to make the Go To Forest Game, which is a little concept needed



You might need some images, sounds and effects as the main influences in the game.

The source of the game was developed with a super compression highest.



The game machine or engine script uses this : https://github.com/Kamekazzze/Game-Builder-Asia


The main concept in the Go To Forest game is the world and its place to be combined with several silent and stand-alone functions.



Control on the game is made simple with the following "mouse_down" and then another call is made into each sub function or variable like a custom object and sprite.



Made it as if we are in the middle of the forest or ready to into the forest.
